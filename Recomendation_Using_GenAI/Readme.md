# Next Gen Recommendation Systems (Personalised Recommendation system using Gen AI)

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on building a **Next-Gen Personalized Recommendation System** using **Generative AI** for meal planning based on individual preferences, dietary requirements, and location. The system leverages machine learning models to generate personalized meal plans and offers alternative meal options while ensuring nutritional balance.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Meal Planning:** Generates weekly meal plans based on user preferences for location, cuisine, and dietary restrictions.
- **Nutritional Information:** Provides detailed nutritional content for each meal, including calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and sugar per 100 grams.
- **Alternatives for Each Meal:** Suggests alternative meal options to add variety while maintaining dietary and nutritional standards.
- **No Repeated Meals:** Ensures no meal repeats within the same week.
- **Configurable Model Parameters:** Supports various model configurations for custom results, including temperature, top_k, and top_p.

## Requirements
To run the project, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.7+
- Gradio for the user interface
- Google Generative AI (`google.generativeai` package)
- Pandas for handling and displaying the meal plans

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install gradio google-generativeai pandas
```

## Project Setup

1. **API Key Setup:**
   You need to configure the Google Generative AI API key in the `genai.configure` function:
   ```python
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

2. **Model Configuration:**
   The system uses Google Generative AI's `Gemini` models. It includes predefined settings for output tokens, temperature, and safety, but these can be adjusted to your needs:
   ```python
   generation_config = {
       "max_output_tokens": 2048,
       "temperature": 0.4,
       "top_k": 40,
       "top_p": 1,
   }
   ```

3. **System Prompt:**
   The default system prompt instructs the AI to generate meal plans based on the userâ€™s location, cuisine preferences, dietary needs, and the day of the week.

4. **Generating Meal Plans:**
   The `generate_response()` function handles the core logic of generating meal plans:
   ```python
   response = generate_response(location="New York", cuisine="Italian", dietary_requirements="Diabetic Type 2")
   ```

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Gradio interface and model integration logic.
- `meal_plan.py`: Core functions for meal generation and alternative suggestions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.
- `sample_responses.json`: Example outputs generated by the model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Example Usage
1. **Launch the Gradio Interface:**
   Run the application and interact with it through a web interface.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Generate Meal Plan:**
   Provide your location, preferred cuisine, and dietary restrictions, and the system will generate a weekly meal plan with alternatives.

3. **Example Output:**
   A JSON response with meal plans for each day, including alternatives:
   ```json
   {
     "weekly_meal_plan": {
       "Monday": {
         "breakfast": {
           "name": "Oatmeal with Berries and Nuts",
           "nutrient_content_per_100g": { "calories": 150, "protein": 5, "carbs": 25, "fiber": 5, "fat": 5 }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
